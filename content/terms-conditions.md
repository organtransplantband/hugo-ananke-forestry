TERMS & CONDITIONS

​

Shop repair work must be paid for when the equipment is picked up or at the time of delivery. We do not run credit accounts.

​

Repaired equipment will not be released for customer pickup until authorized work is paid in full.

After shop repairs or service is completed, the customer has 30 days to pay for work and pick up equipment or accept delivery. If an invoice is not paid within 30 days of notification of completion of work, and equipment picked up, equipment is subject to being sold to cover the shop charges. If the sale price exceeds the amount of the invoice, the balance will be returned to the customer.

​

We do not run storage facilities for customers' equipment. Any equipment dropped off for evaluation must have repairs authorized within 10 days of evaluation or be picked up by the customer. If not, equipment will be moved to a nearby rental storage unit and attract a storage fee of $25 per month or a portion thereof per item of equipment.

​

Sales tax is charged and collected for the State of Louisiana and Livingston Parish.
