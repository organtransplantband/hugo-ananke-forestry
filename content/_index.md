Welcome to our new website. It is under construction, so for now, most of the key information is on this home page. Feel free to contact me, James Skinner, or my manager (wife), Patsy, for further information or assistance.

We have specialized in sales, rentals, and service of vintage Hammond organs and Leslie speaker systems since 1998. Our customer list includes more than 60 churches in the Baton Rouge, Louisiana area, extending out up to 100 miles. Our rental customers have included Chubby Checker, Eric Burden, Dr. John, Joey DeFrancesco, the Meters, the Neville Brothers, Manship Theatre, Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra, Gospel Music Workshop of America (GMWA) and Southern University of Baton Rouge.

We service vintage vacuum tube based equipment only, not transistorized solid state equipment. Organ sales and service is limited to Hammond B2, B3, C2, C3 and A100 series organs. We do not service solid state or transistorized equipment.

There is no brick & mortar store. Organ & Leslie inventory & service shop are located at our residence. Visitors are welcome but please call first to be sure we are not out on a service call or delivery.

A substantial inventory of premium grade Hammonds and Leslies are in stock for sale. See the inventory list for current stock.
