The standard Organ Transplant Leslie amp is our own updated version of the Leslie 147 / 122 amplifier, with modifications to improve reliability and reduce hum. These amps are built using original Leslie chassis that have been stripped to bare steel, then electroless nickel plated. The only original components that may be reused are the transformers and choke. All other parts are new.

​

The design incorporates elements of the 147 and 122 amplifiers. The audio circuitry is mostly 122 and the Leslie speed control circuit is Type 6B as used by the 147. The OC3 regulator tube is replaced by a pair of 5 watt zener diodes. The multi-section can capacitor is replaced by individual 500V rated aluminum electrolytic capacitors mounted on the motherboard.

Most of the electronic components have been moved to a printed circuit board. This board features separate bias adjustment for each of the 6550 power tubes, permitting perfect balance of idle currents. Additional trimmer pots are provided to balance the phase-splitter drive signals to the two 6550s. The 1.5 amp Slo-Blo fuse is in a fuse clip that permits easy replacement with no soldering required.

It has been said that all Leslies hum. That is true of most that I have heard, even the highly touted balanced-input 122. Turns out that most of the hum is coming from sources that the balanced input has no ability to stop. Review of old tube amp design manuals from the 1950s and 1960s reveal a number of basic hum reduction techniques that were not included in the original Leslie amp designs.

Filament (heater) wiring should be twisted tightly and routed well away from audio signal wiring. The OT Leslie amp follows this best practice. Stock amps do not. The 6.3V AC filament heater power should be sourced from a center-tapped secondary transformer winding, with the center tap grounded. Where there is no center-tap, a pair of 100 ohm resistors may be used to create a virtual grounded center-tap. The OT Leslie amp follows this practice as well.

The audio ground should be separate from the power supply ground, a basic practice not followed by the original Leslie amps but included in the OT Leslie amp.

​

The complete mother board may be replaced in less than 10 minutes by any competent technician without any soldering required. All connections are via terminal strips around the edge of the board. For our local customers, we keep complete spare amps on the shelf for instant exchange in an emergency.
