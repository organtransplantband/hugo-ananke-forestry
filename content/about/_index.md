Organ Transplant, LLC is owned and operated by James & Patsy Skinner. The name of the company came out of the numerous organs we found ourselves moving (transplanting) for rentals, repairs, and sales. Although most transplants are local, typically within 50 - 100 miles, we routinely travel from Louisiana to the Canadian border and all points in between picking up and delivering organs.

​

Until recently, we did no advertising other than business cards. Our customers do most of our advertising for us, by word-of-mouth, the best kind!

​

Our niche in the vintage Hammond organ business is servicing the needs of the larger churches and institutions that must have absolute reliability and high quality equipment for critical performances that must come off consistently and on schedule. We are not cheap, but we are the best.

My professional background was electrical & instrumentation engineering for the process industries which I retired from recently, now devoting full-time to the organ business. This background has served me well for troubleshooting tube amp problems and designing a number of reliability and performance improvements. Result is that our organs and Leslies have little or no hum and are acclaimed by our customers as being the best available.

​

We provide loaner organs and Leslies for our local customers when their equipment must be shopped for repairs, or cannot be quickly repaired on site. Our typical inventory of 15-20 organs and 5-10 Leslies makes it possible to provide this service.

​

Remanufactured preamps for B3, C3, and A100 organs are kept on the shelf for quick exchange, as are fresh re-manufactured Leslie tube amplifiers.

​

Check out the Leslie amp page for our Hot Rod Leslie 147 / 122 amplifier. For a screaming top end and fat bottom end, these amps can't be beat.
