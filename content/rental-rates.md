RENTAL RATES

​

\*Local = within 25 miles of our shop @ ZIP code 70726

​

1 day rental of Hammond B3/C3 + Leslie = $400

2 day rental of Hammond B3/C3 + Leslie = $550

​

Extended rentals: $550 covers any period of 2 days up to one month.

Extended rentals may come with a lease-purchase option if requested before the rental is contracted. If the equipment is purchased, the first month's rental applies to the purchase price.

​

Out of town rentals (not local) will be billed an additional $1/mile each way for any mileage in excess of 25 miles each way.

​

For most critical rental occasions, we provide dual Leslie speakers at no extra cost. For some of the most critical cases, the Joey DeFrancesco concert, for example, we brought two B3s and two Leslies just to be sure, again at no additional charge.

​

We only rent complete organ + Leslie packages. We will not rent a Leslie to be connected to someone else's organ, nor rent an organ to connect to someone else's Leslie. This is due to the variety of interconnecting wiring schemes that may be encountered, for example plugging a Leslie 147 into a receptacle wired for a Leslie 122 results in no control of the Leslie motor speed control and potential damage to equipment.
